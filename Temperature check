"""Temperature check
The following code should receive a temperature reading from a sensor placed in a water container and report: 'Hot' for temperature above 40°C; 'Warm' for temperature between 25 and 40°C; 'Cold' for less than 25°C; 'Invalid' if below 0 or above 100°C. Check if it works correctly. If not, what is the problem? What would be a solution?

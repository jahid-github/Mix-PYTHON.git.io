sns.scatterplot(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6])

**5. Scikit-learn**
- Purpose: Machine learning.
- Features:
Offers tools for supervised and unsupervised learning, such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
Includes preprocessing utilities and evaluation metrics.
- Example:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression().fit([[1], [2], [3]], [4, 5, 6])
print(model.predict([[4]]))

**6. TensorFlow**
- Purpose: Deep learning and large-scale numerical computing.
- Features:
Provides a comprehensive ecosystem for training and deploying machine learning models.
Works efficiently with large datasets using GPUs and TPUs.
- Example:
python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
print(tf.reduce_sum(x))

**7. Keras**
- Purpose: Simplified deep learning.
- Features:
High-level API for building and training neural networks, built on top of TensorFlow.
Easy to use for beginners and efficient for research.
- Example:
python
Copy code

- Purpose: Scientific computing.
- Features:
Provides advanced mathematical, statistical, and scientific functions.
Includes modules for optimization, signal processing, and more.
- Example:
python
Copy code
from scipy.optimize import minimize
result = minimize(lambda x: x**2, x0=2)
print(result)
**9. Plotly**
- Purpose: Interactive data visualization.
- Features:
Creates interactive, web-based visualizations like 3D plots, dashboards, and time series charts.
Integrates with Jupyter Notebooks for dynamic exploration.
- Example:
python
Copy code
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6])
fig.show()

**10. Statsmodels**
- Purpose: Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.
- Features:
Offers tools for linear regression, time series analysis, and econometrics.
Provides detailed statistical summaries for model evaluation.
- Example:
python
Copy code
import statsmodels.api as sm
model = sm.OLS([4, 5, 6], sm.add_constant([1, 2, 3]))
results = model.fit()
print(results.summary())

"""Shipping costs
The following code should calculate the shipping cost for an online store based on the purchase amount:

    Free shipping for purchases above $200
    $15 shipping fee for purchases between $100 and $200
    $25 shipping fee for purchases between $50 and $100
    $35 shipping fee for purchases under $50
    The code should print 'Invalid Amount' if the purchase value is negative"
Here is one solution, but it is not working correctly. First, think about how many values you need to cover all the options. Then, identify and correct the bugs.
"""
purchase_amount = int(input("Enter purchase amount: $"))
discount = 100 / (purchase_amount - 200)

if purchase_amount < 0:
    print("Invalid Amount")
elif purchase_amount > 200:
    print("Free Shipping")
elif purchase_amount > 100:
    print("Shipping cost: $15")
elif purchase_amount >= 50:
    print("Shipping cost: $25")
else:
    print("Shipping cost: $35")
